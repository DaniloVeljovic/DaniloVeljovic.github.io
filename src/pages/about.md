I'm a Software Engineer specializing in JVM languages, with a strong passion for crafting high-performance, scalable systems. My focus is on delivering user-centric software that combines my love for software engineering, distributed systems, and creating real value for people. I’ve worked on a whole range of problems, from implementing a billing system for a Fitness application in a small outsourcing company to running a workstream to systematically identify and prepare software systems for a multi-billion dollar company's ‘CyberWeek’ event.

Throughout this journey, I've come to realize that the collaboration of dedicated colleagues, open to exploring and questioning the very essence of software and well-designed systems, is absolutely indispensable in our field.
